      <p>Hi all! I'm <strong>Matthew Allen Curtis</strong>, a Software Engineering student based in Victoria, BC.</p>
      <p>Right now, the two areas that excite me most are <strong>data compression</strong>—especially <em>video compression</em>—and <strong>educational technology</strong>.</p>
      <p>I’m currently working on an <strong>educational videogame website</strong> for card-based math games. Think <a href="https://www.coolmathgames.com" class="underline text-blue-600">coolmathgames.com</a> but with card games!</p>
      <p>I'm also deeply involved in my school's <a href="https://www.uvicecss.ca" class="underline text-blue-600">Engineering and Computer Science Students' Society</a>, having served as <strong>President</strong>, <strong>VP Internal</strong>, and <strong>VP Corporate</strong>.</p>
      <p>This site is a place where I share what I’m working on, what I’m learning, and things I think are cool.</p>
